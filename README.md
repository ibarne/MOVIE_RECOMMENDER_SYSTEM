## PROBLEM STATEMENT

In this digital era there has been a increase in the number of online users and its steeply increasing day by day, with this there has been increase in the number of viewers in websites who streams movie online, a lot of such websites fail to retain their customers, one of the reason for such failure can be due to the fact that users don’t get the proper suggestion for them to watch which they will like. In this Recommender System I try to suggest users’ movies/tv shows based on their likes, so that to keep them intact to the website or app.
